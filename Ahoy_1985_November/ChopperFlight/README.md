Chopper Flight is a game I wrote in 1984/85 timeframe 
with my friend Kevin Woram when we were in our teenage
years.  It is written in C64 BASIC and was published
in the November 1985 issue of "Ahoy!" magazine as a 
type-in game.  

See the text of the game play description directly 
from the magazine below.

CHOPPER FLIGHT FOR THE C-64
BY MIKE BUHIDAR, JR.and KEVIN WORAM

In Chopper Flight, you are a civilian helicopter pilot
who has been called upon by his country to fly a
rescue mission. A group of ruthless terrorists have
captured two adjacent apartment buildings in your
city and are holding all the tenants hostage. If their
demands are not met in one hour, they threaten to blow
up the building, killing themselves and all of the 
inhabitants. The nearest military helicopter base is
too far away to send help in time, so you have been
asked to use your own personal chopper to rescue the
hostages. However, the terrorists don't appreciate your
sense of duty and they
start to fire anti-aircraft shells at you. Shonly before a
shell is fired, you will hear a warning noise. If you hurry, 
you can guide your chopper onto a ledge where you
will have some measure of safety. When the terrorists
realize that you could ruin their plans, they send for a
heat- eeking missile which automatically homes in on
your chopper. However, before the missile is fired, the
border of the screen wiU tum orange and then red. This
is a warning that your time is almost up.
As the game begins, you are asked to enter the difficulty of
the mission. The skill level ranges from one to six,
one being the easiest, six being the hardest. The height
of the building and the amount of time before the heatseeking
missile is fired depend on the skill level you seleet. Also, 
your maneuverability varies with the difficulty of your mission.
To maneuver your chopper, use a joystick plugged into
control port 2. To control your rate of descent, hold down
the fire button on your controller. After a short period
of holding down the button, your helicopter will begin
to hover. At this point you can maneuver your craft between 
the ledges to rescue the hostages. Releasing the
fire button will cause the chopper to begin descending
again. Movement in all eight directions is possible. However, 
do not try to move your chopper off the top or bottom of the 
screen; once a section of the building has scrolled off
the top of the screen, it is gone and you cannot go back to it. 
Likewise, the only way to descend to the lower parts of the 
building is to allow your chopper
to drop by releasing the fire button.
On every fourth floor of one of the buildings, you will
see a hostage standing on a ledge. To save him, slow your
chopper's downward fall to a hover and maneuver your
chopper between the ledges. As soon as you touch the
hostage, he is replaced by a heart symbol to show that
he is safely on board. If you allow a hostage to scroll
off the top ofthe screen, he is beyond help and you cannot save him.
If you are able to reach the bottom without crashing
into the building, being hit by a shell, or running out
of time, you will receive one hundred points for every
man you have rescued. Also, extra points are awarded
for the difficulty of your mission and for completing it
in the least amount of time.
